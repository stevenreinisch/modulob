migration + ui
--------------

- overall concept: 
	- how is migration created
	- how are related models created/updated
		- how is migration model stored? as xmi? as xtext dsl?

- action for creation of new entity model version
- wizard for creation of new version (new version must be specified)
- model cloning

- how to handle diff model?
- supply EntityModelsSelectionPage with paths of selected files
- read entity models from these paths and supply EntityMappingWizard with these models
- EntityMappingWizard re-adds pages if entity models are set
